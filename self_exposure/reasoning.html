        <h2 style="color: lightcoral;" class = "goal"> My goal in life is to become a great programmer and an even better problem-solver.</h2>
        <p class = "reasoning_text"> This has been something that's originated as a younger child, but I never took initiative to learn about programming because 
            I thought that it would be <span class = "highlight"><b>too hard.</b></span> I guess that my mind at the time didn't want to take on such a challenge. 
            I knew since a child that I wanted to be some sort of an engineer, before I even knew what an engineer actually was.
        </p>
        <p class = "reasoning_text">
            Up until high school graduation, <span style = "text-decoration:underline">I never truly had a grasp on reality</span>. I never knew what I wanted to do nor did I decide to take the time to think about what I wanted to do until I basically had to make a choice.
            <br>
            <br>
            This created a time where I had to take a deep dive within myself and reflect on what it is I wanted out of life, do I want to continue wasting time when I know there's much more to life than what's distracting me?
            <br>
            So, I decided to finally take a shot and start pursuing in a career I've been meaning to pursue in for a very long time, <span style = "font-style:oblique;">Computer Science</span>.
            <br>
            <br>
            So far, I've been loving the process including the infamously strenuous math curriculum (though I haven't went into Calculus yet, I still have one more semester of the broken up Precalculus)
            <br> and am very excited to continue learning as I refuse to let anything get in my way of my goal. No matter the difficulty, <span style = "font-style:oblique;">failure is not an option</span>.
