                My name is Jeremiah Louis-Pierre. I'm 20 years old, and I'm an aspiring developer that's constantly trying to improve not only 
                through programming, but also academically.

                I was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Then when I turned about 2 years old, was then raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but this 
                lasted up until I turned 12. <br> 
                At this point, I then resided in Dillon, South Carolina until I turned 14. Finally, due to my mother wanting to move once again, I've been living in Fayetteville, North Carolina since then.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am currently studying Engineering here at FTCC, with the plan to transfer to NC State University with the declared major of Computer Science.
                <br>
                <br>
                I've honestly always had a small amount of hobbies, but a lot of time is spent on each hobby. Growing up, my hobbies consisted of riding bikes, and playing video games. 
                <br>
                Nowadays, my hobbies consists of programming, reading something programming related, and sometimes watching anime.
